This is We Don't Always Agree, the podcast where we thrive on hard conversations. I'm Ryan Michelle Bethe. And I'm Sterling K. Brown. We said I do almost 20 years ago. And two things about us, we love each other deeply and we can disagree deeply about a lot of things. That's true, but we've been learning how to disagree healthily. And this show is our way of pulling back the curtain and sharing our evolution with you. Bird, is you ready? Child, I'm ready. Are you ready? Let's go, big dog. Bird, is you ready? Child, I'm ready. Are you ready? Let's go, big dog. We Don't Always Agree is recorded at the Blackbird House flagship in Culver City, California. Let's do this. Yo, you ready, Bird? Yes, I'm ready. You know what we're talking about today? I do. I do. We're talking about talking. And I know that I need to communicate. We're talking about communication. Are you? What's wrong? You look good. What's wrong? You trying to shove my shoulder? No, it's just it's a whole it's a whole situation. Are you comfortable? I am not comfortable in my skin. What do you need to do to be comfortable? I am cozy. You're such a strange person. Because we're talking about communication here. That's why. So I want you to be comfortable. And that leads us right into communication is key, right? But how does one communicate? I'm sorry. When I think about Beyonce, I just, I can't. I have to like, I need to be, I need to my factory settings. This is episode two. Reset. Here we go. It's going to be a long season. As long as I don't think about Beyonce. What do you want to, what do you want to say about communication? I would like to start here. Okay. Sterling. Ryan. If you had to define it, what kind of communicator are you? How do you communicate? I think that, I think I'm a deep thinker. You are a Negro. I almost called you something else. This is episode two. Do you disagree? You suck, bro. Deep thoughts with Jack Candy. Yes, you are a deep thinker. We can run that back. Go ahead. No, we're going to shit back. I want the world to see how you treat me on a regular basis. This is what I want. Hey, listen. I like... You know me. I'm always... See, anything I say now, you're going to lambast. No, I'm sorry. I'm not going to lambast anything. You totally are. There's no lambing or basting. No, no, because I, you know what it is? I already knew what I was about to say, and then I stopped myself from saying it because I was like, she's about to clown. I'm not going to clown. Watch this, guys. Watch this. I think that the primary purpose in life is to become the next best version of yourself, right? I would agree. So evolution is, you know, basically what we're talking about. You have to be able to understand your past to be able to sort of deal with your present so you can create the future that you want. You didn't make fun of me. I appreciate that. That was really good. So I ask lots of questions. You suck. good. So I ask lots of questions. I ask lots of questions of myself and the people around me, because I think in a very sort of Socratic way, we get to a deeper understanding of why we make the choices that we make. So I ask questions like all the time, like almost to the point that you are annoyed by. Like, I think my level of inquisitiveness, oftentimes we'll leave like a party. And you'll tell me something about somebody, and I'll be like, oh, did you ask him this? And you're like, no. I'm like, how could you not, how do you leave that on the table? Like, the natural sort of thing to do. I think that you, and we're at odds at this, right? Because you don't ask as many questions. You often tell me that you ask stupid questions, Sterling. Which we always learned in school was not true. But according to Ryan Michelle Bethea, there are plenty of stupid questions that someone can ask. I have not. First of all, I have not said that in a long time. Have you said it? In the entire time that I've known you, yes. I have said that there's a stupid question. In the entire time that I've known you, sure. She agreed. Since we've had children, no. Not true. That is true. If I ask for directions, go ahead and tell them. This is where the masculine energy of Ryan Michelle Bathay and the feminine, because Brown is like, if I'm lost, I'm going to ask somebody where to go. And you are what? Yeah. Here's the thing. Let's do it. Here's the thing. Qualify. Here's the thing. Let's do it. Here's the thing. Qualify. Here's the thing. With a Kate. First of all. Yes, ma'am. You will ask anybody directions anywhere, anytime. You don't. The safety has nothing. We remember when we drove across country and you pulled over in the middle of West Texas. And you just like you randomly walked up to the guy. I was like, Sterling, we're at a Klan rally. We should probably keep driving. And you were like, oh, it's gotta be fine. It sounded like the Chappelle joke. Sure enough. Where the white guy walks up to the police officer and goes, excuse me, officer, I'm a little high. So that's, that's, that's first of all. Second of all, I will take, I will take responsibility for the fact that I do not like it when you ask for directions because I always know where I'm going. And I take it as a personal offense. Why would you do that? I don't know. First of all, you don't always know where you're going. I do. No, you don't. I do. I have an excellent sense of direction. You have an excellent sense of direction. I have an excellent sense of direction. I have no problems with meandering. And people are trying to get somewhere on time. I don't meander. I don't meander. I don't meander. But the reason why I always know where I'm going and the reason why I have an excellent sense of direction and the reason why I always know where I'm going is because every once in a while, if I take a wrong turn, what does it do? It clicks into my brain and it gives me a 3d map of where i'm going you never know where you're going talk about what kind of communicator you are let's let's go direct okay we'll define that that directness when is that i know my directions that's how i define direct how what tell me why the questions like because we have a different sort of thing with regards to the questions why do they sort of trigger things with you sometimes? Sometimes you'll ask me questions and I'll be like, I don't know. And you're like, well, if you did know, what would you say? Because you don't engage, man. I am engaging. I do engage. You engage like our son, Andrew. And I'll be like, hey, I try to make like an open-ended sort of invitation for a dialogue. And you're like, I don't know, Sterling. That's a good question. Like, well, nigga, if it's a good question, why don't you try answering it? Why do we have to use an N-word? Why I gotta be N-word? Why I gotta be N-word? Why don't you try answering it? You can say ninja. I try, but this is what, and this is where, this is why we go to therapy. Why? Because we have very different styles of communicating. And you're just like, why don't you just answer? And I'm like, I need time to process. And oftentimes, and here's the thing. Here's the thing I feel in our relationship. You oftentimes expect me to be able to answer right in the moment. And you think that I'm just not answering because I don't want to answer. And you don't understand that I am processing, but it sometimes takes me a minute to process. And I have learned over the years that if I say something, it typically gets lodged in your brain as how it is and the truth. And I don't always feel like there's room for that to not be true or how it is. Like if I say that don't always feel like there's room for that to not be true or how it is. Like, if I say that's a stupid question in the heat of the moment 15 years ago, you're like, ah, you said it once, so therefore... Oh, you shouldn't be accountable for your words. Oh, my God. That's it? Can you just"

For me, the year 2020 presents an alchemy of highlights and lowlights. The pandemic and the ensuing shutdown of the country were alarming. Yet simultaneously, there was this racial renaissance. It prompted this nation to confront its ugly history of white versus black. And while the world was working to find its way back to normal, there were two young women who had graduated high school that very year, preparing to embark on their collegiate and athletic careers. Both highly touted players from two different backgrounds, two different playing styles, but arguably the same agenda to be the best. Because of COVID and different restrictions across the country, and if we're honest, lack of interest, the world wasn't focused on women's college basketball. So for the masses, Kaitlyn Clark and Angel Reese seemingly became famous overnight. However, as we find out in this series, Kaitlyn Clark and Angel Reese were supernovas in the making. The masses were just late to the discovery. Clark and Reese clearly represent so much more than basketball. They represent resilience, possibility, and resistance. Dare I say, their on-the-court rivalry is what we all needed to push this country out of archaic archetypes that surround the game and filter the way we see women's sports in general. archetypes that surround the game and filter the way we see women's sports in general. Clark and Reese have expanded the horizons of the game in ways that my humble mind never envisioned. So how did we reach this point? Allow me to tell you a story. The Superman needed Lex Luthor. The Batman needed the Joker. And I don't mean to put Angel Reese in some kind of villainous role because I don't consider her a villain, but I think every great player needs a foil. The reason why we watch that women's basketball is not just because of one person. It's because of me too. You know, I don't think there should be any criticism for what she did. I honestly didn't see it when the game was going on. But the story became more compelling and the desire to watch and talk about it became more compelling when she had a foil. Angel won a national championship. She has four million plus followers. She's at the Met Gala. SZA and Meg Thee Stallion want to come sit courtside and watch her. Naked Sports, The Making of a Rivalry, a six-episode docu-series that explores the media frenzy surrounding two supernovas in Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. I'm your host, Keri Champion, and welcome to The Making of a Rivalry. Typically, what it takes is for there to be a rivalry, a moment, a star player that comes along that makes us think differently about the game and gets everybody sort of galvanized behind either a sport, a player, a moment. It's always something. You know, there's been watershed moments in like Major League Baseball. You could say when integration occurred. You could say when Hank Aaron broke Babe Ruth's home run record. There's a new home run champion of all time, and it's Henry Aaron. There's been these moments that you can just recall off the top of your head that you felt like the sport itself was ascending to a higher place. And so we've been able to experience that. Jemele Hill covered women's basketball in the beginning of her career. And I call her a grisly media veteran. And she says that this moment in women's basketball has been building. But Kaitlyn Clark and Angel Reese, well, those two, they set off this explosion of interest. This moment in women's basketball is shape-shifting. I think a lot of us who have covered women's basketball and women's sports in particular, I think there's other sports you can point to that moment when it happened, where you saw there was a decided shifting move that took the league from one place while growing, but to an exponential growth. And I'm just really happy I was alive as someone whose first professional beat was the WNBA when I was a young cub reporter. So what I would say is that, yeah, it's shape-shifting. It's changing not just the league, it's changing culture, it's changing the way we look at female athletes. I think the last, I would say the last three to five years, it was a steady increase, and then it was like, boom, the rocket hit. The WNBA is in its 28th season, but if you start to think about it, some would say it feels as if history is repeating itself. Jamel reminds us that the NBA, you know, where the men play, wasn't always a ratings juggernaut. People often forget just how poorly the NBA was thought of. You know, before Magic and Bird kind of took the lead to another level, you're talking about, you know, finals games being on tape delay. of took the lead to another level.

Time is beginning to run out in a presidential race that appears to remain very tight. I think that the surprise wouldn't be if either Trump or Harris won. The surprise would be if it wasn't close. either Trump or Harris won, the surprise would be if it wasn't close. I'm Dave Anthony. Another hurricane is coming. Days after one that caused devastation far away from the coast. So we focus on homeowners insurance for everybody. And it turns out a lot of us may have less coverage than we think. Nobody wants to have that because you file a claim and then realize you're not going to get enough money to rebuild your home. We've seen this in wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes. I'm Jake Matthews. I've got the final word on Fox News Rundown. Four weeks to Election Day. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump are sprinting to the finish and fighting to gain ground. In a real clear politics average, Harris has a 2% lead nationally, while Trump has an edge of one-tenth of 1% in seven battleground states. This is going to be a very tight race until the very end. This is going to be a very tight race until the very end. We are the underdog and we know we have some hard work ahead. Harris rallying in Michigan Friday as former President Trump returned to Butler, Pennsylvania on Saturday. Very big thank you to Pennsylvania. We love Pennsylvania. And as I was saying, picking up where he left off when he was shot at a Butler rally in July, both candidates and their running mates making repeated trips to swing states that could decide the election race where it is now, as opposed to several months ago, when when when Joe Biden was still, you know, the presumptive Democratic nominee, is that there are just fewer undecideds and there are fewer people saying they're going to vote third party. Kyle Kondik is managing editor for Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. politics. And when you have a lot of undecideds, and when you have a lot of people saying you're going to vote third party, that leads to, I think, some maybe choppiness or malleability into the electorate. And particularly because when people say they're going to vote third party, usually what happens is that that percentage kind of dwindles as you get close to the election. And then sometimes the third party candidates underperform their polling. But when Harris got in, it basically just kind of ended up removing a lot of people from the undecided and third-party columns. So you got all these polls that are like, you know, Trump 49-47 in Georgia, or Harris 50-47 in Michigan, or, you know, I'm just kind of making up numbers, but these are the kind of numbers that you see. And there really aren't that many undecideds out there. There aren't that many people saying they're voting third party. And so the campaigns are kind of fixated on a relatively small group of undecided voters who are difficult to profile and frankly, difficult to find and difficult to appeal to. And so, you know, you're seeing the candidates, you know, go on, you know, kind of, because I call it sort of alternative forms of media, trying to reach certain kinds of people who may not be, you know, watching cable news or whatnot or may not be plugged into the campaign. But there's a lot of time and energy being devoted to reaching a lot of reaching a relatively small amount of people who, again, are pretty hard to reach. I want to take a moment here to distinguish between third party and independent or unaffiliated voters, right? Because I'm wondering, are the independents, the unaffiliateds, are they still the biggest voting bloc in the country? And has there been a shift that's been seen at this point in the way that those voters are leaning? Well, look, there are a lot of people who call themselves independents, although when you really drill down, a lot of them will admit to kind of a leaned party preference. And so you can find a poll that might say, you know, 35 to 40 percent of Americans see themselves as independents. But the real number is a lot smaller than that. You know, different polls say different things about which way independents are leaning. You know, some will show Trump leading with independence, some will show Harris leading with independence. You might think the candidate who wins independence would win the election. That's not necessarily always true. A good example is, you know, George W. Bush was the last Republican to win the national popular vote. And, you know, the sources suggested that John Kerry, the Democrat that year, actually won independence. But, you know, the sources suggested that John Kerry, the Democrat, that year actually won independence. But, you know, Bush triumphed in part because of a more robust Republican turnout in that election. The people who really pay the most attention are the ones that typically have pretty strong opinions that aren't very movable. They're either,"

It's a Tuesday, July 14th, 1970. The sun is coming up over New York City. And word is out that a militant group has taken over a hospital. This is not a candy store that took over. It took over a hospital. We didn't know how bad it was. This is Sid Davidoff. He worked for the mayor's office at the time. They're still putting their reports together. It's very sketchy. B bunch of people taking over a floor. They claim to have hostages and they have a list of demands and they want to talk to somebody. Sid is the guy that the mayor's office would call in to deal with crises across the city. He'd negotiated with gangs in Manhattan, coordinated responses to race riots in Brooklyn. And so when he heard that some radicals were taking over a hospital, Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx, he rushed over. Police were already there, surrounding the place. And it was chaos. Ambulances are pulling up. People are sick. People are dying, maybe. They got 50 cops ready to come in and do what has to be done. Who knows what's going to happen? Inside are the radicals. About 100 women and men. Some are in fatigues, big army boots. And everyone is wearing purple berets. They're standing by the door. They're being very militant, you know. They're using their force, their anger. We had to get them out of the hospital. So who were these people in their purple berets? And why were they trying to take over a hospital? Well, they were the Young Lords, and we're about to hear their story. It's a fight to save thousands of lives. A fight that is still at the forefront of American politics today. The Young Lords Party began an occupation of part of the Lincoln Hospital complex. That building was condemned 25 years ago. Condemned. The Young Lords opened up Pandora's box, is what they did. You're not going to get anything from this country. You're not going to change by pray-ins, love-ins, and all other kinds of be-ins. You're going to get it through armed struggle. It's the only way.

        "text": " Over here at Serial, we love criminal justice stories. Guantanamo is the most astonishing one we've ever seen. Guantanamo is a prison and a court that we made from scratch right after September 11th. We were at war in Afghanistan fighting al-Qaeda and the Taliban, and pretty soon we'd captured thousands of men. Our makeshift holding cells in Afghanistan couldn't handle them all. We needed a safe place to keep them, away from the chaos, so we could sort them out. And the place we chose was Guantanamo Bay, 8,000 miles away from Afghanistan, in Cuba. We already had a sleepy naval base there. We've had it since 1903. There's plenty of room, and this part was crucial. The Bush administration figured because the base was in Cuba, on foreign soil, the prisoners we delivered there wouldn't have access to U.S. courts. That was the innovation. We wanted leeway to hold these guys for however long we wanted, and mostly we wanted to interrogate them, however we wanted, to find out what they knew, especially about al-Qaeda. Because we didn't know a ton about al-Qaeda back then, and we were petrified they were about to blindside us again. So that was the idea. Guantanamo wouldn't be a traditional POW camp. It'd be a new thing, with new rules. The problem, well, there were many, many problems. But the problem that dogged Guantanamo the whole time, and which became apparent pretty quickly, was that these weren't the guys we thought they were. All told, 780 Muslim men and some boys were held at Guantanamo. And even the ones who were Taliban or al-Qaeda, they were overwhelmingly low-level, like foot soldiers. Other prisoners, we never figured out exactly who they were or if they posed a threat to us. Our intel wasn't so hot. We'd shipped all these prisoners to Guantanamo without a solid plan for letting them back out. Many people sat there for two, three, five years, and some 12 years, 14 years, 16 years. We didn't know what to do with them. 30 men are still held at Guantanamo. And the cost? The last time someone tallied it up, $13 million a year, per prisoner. Guantanamo is probably the most expensive lockup in the world. Astonishing, no? Dana Chivas and I, Dana's worked on previous seasons of Serial. She's going to be my co-host this season. Dana and I have been trying to do a story about Guantanamo for years, almost a decade. for years, almost a decade. Our first attempt was in 2015. Sarah and I had flown down to Guantanamo, or Gitmo as it's often called, for the official media tour, the only way we could see the prison. The experience was strange, almost as soon as we arrived. We were picked up at the airport by two soldiers from Public Affairs. Would any of you guys like to stop at the small little mini-mart real quick on this side? It's just a small one just to get if you want a snack or something. They also have souvenirs there, but you'll have another chance to get more souvenirs on the other side. Guantanamo has three gift shops. Recently, the gift shops did a collaboration with Disney, so you could bring home a t-shirt that says Guantanamo Bay with a Minnie Mouse on it. Or one with palm trees that says, it don't get mo better than this. For the mindful, there was a coffee mug with a simple mantra. Be here now, Guantanamo Bay. We passed up the souvenir offer on day one. Maybe you caught Sarah's hesitation in the tape. Because how inappropriate. We passed up the souvenir offer on day one.

        "text": " TED Audio Collective. Thanks to Canva for sponsoring this episode. It was the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, and the U.S. men's hockey team was facing off against the Soviets. On paper, the winner looked obvious. The Soviet team had won gold in four straight Olympics. Just a year earlier, they'd beaten the NHL All-Star team. And just three days before the Olympics started, the Soviets had destroyed the U.S. team 10-3. Yeah, they were the best. You know, it could beat you at the top end of their lineup, or they could beat you at the back end of their lineup or they could beat you at the back end of their lineup. John Harrington was on the U.S. team. They knew the odds were stacked against them. At that time, it wasn't like, hey, we think we can win this thing. It was like, we're hoping to get to the medal round. And I think we rallied around that feeling that we were underdogs. That might have given them an extra boost because as the games began, the U.S. team started winning and upsetting higher-ranked teams. And I think as games went on, each game went on, we were getting better as a group. We were getting more confident as a group. All of a sudden, they found themselves in the medal round, facing down the Soviet team. To have a shot at gold, they had to beat the best team in the world. Team captain Mike Aruzzione remembers the anticipation in the locker room. It was quiet. This is the biggest game we'd ever played, and it's quiet. Nobody in the world thought we could win. The Soviets scored early on. The U.S. matched it. And the game continued, neck and neck. And I remember as that game went on, you're still almost thinking like, hey, at any time, these guys can fill up the back of the net. So it was like playing every second. We had to be at the top of our game or things might go wrong. Then came the deciding moment in the last period. The game was tied 3-3. John passed to a teammate, who passed to Mike, who took a shot and... Well, I'm glad it went in. The arena went absolutely nuts. I mean, it absolutely went crazy. It was just like, holy smokes, like, here we are. This dream we all had about going to the Olympics and being successful and winning a gold medal, like, we were there. We were getting there, and it was possible. Somehow, the team managed to hang on for the last 10 minutes. Then announcer Al Michaels made his famous call. You believe in miracles? Yes! Yeah, I always kid Al Michaels. I said, Al, you know, it wasn't a miracle, but that's a really catchy phrase. The game became known as the Miracle on Ice. You've probably heard the story or seen the movie. But what you haven't heard is the science that helps to illuminate how the U.S. team won. It's not just relevant to winning a gold medal. It can also bring out the best in us and make our own teams better. I'm Adam Grant, and this is Work Life, my podcast with its head audio collective. I'm an organizational psychologist. I study how to make work not suck. In this show, we explore how to unlock the potential in people and workplaces. Today, team effectiveness and how to make a group more than the sum of its parts. What I was really preoccupied with was, how come the groups that I am in always seem to suck so bad? And that I wanted to understand, because there was possibly a personal relevance there. Richard Hackman was the world's leading expert on teams, and even he couldn't make them work. Richard was one of my mentors. Back in 2001, I had no idea what to do with my psychology major. Then I took his class on organizational psychology, and I was hooked. He dazzled us with his studies of teams in a wide range of settings, from airline cockpit crews to symphony orchestras to government intelligence units. Richard passed away in 2013, so I couldn't record a conversation with him. But we do have some archival audio. He once explained his struggles with teams on the People and Projects podcast. Well, of course, it is widely known that people who study something can't practice it. So, I mean, you know, shrinks are crazy. Marriage counselors get divorced. Shoemakers' kids have holes in their soles. And people who study groups are probably terrible at actually leading or being in groups. I find them frustrating beyond belief. Many of Richard's peers believe that the secret to improving groups was team building exercises. They assumed that icebreakers and bonding activities fueled liking and helped groups collaborate effectively. I'm guessing you probably know a few managers who still have the same theory, and you've probably had to suffer through a lot of name games and escape rooms as a result. But Richard wasn't sold. He thought we had cause and effect backward. A lot of people will go out and say, oh, the problem with this team is there's a lot of conflict and there's mistrust in one another. So what we will do are trust exercises to build trust. And there really is a cart horse problem here because trust really is important. I agree with that. But trust emerges from a team that is operating well. It doesn't work the other way around. Sure enough, the evidence shows that teams don't have to sing kumbaya together to start excelling together. It's not liking that drives performance. It's often hyper"

        "text": " This is Crime House. For most of American history, there was this feeling that politicians were supposed to be trustworthy, that they were leaders the American public could look up to. But in 1971, that confidence in the government started to slip. And for many Americans, that distrust started with Richard Nixon. Remember the line, I am not a crook? Obviously, he was. But not in the way you might think. See, the Watergate scandal was just the straw that broke the camel's back. Before all that, Nixon was already committing all sorts of crimes. A lot of them had to do with finance. And he left a pretty lengthy paper trail. As the saying goes, those who don't understand history are doomed to repeat it. That's especially true when it comes to money. If you want to make the right decisions when it comes to managing your assets, you need to know what mistakes to avoid and how to spot a trap. This is Money Crimes, a Crime House original. I'm your host, Nicole Lampin. Every Thursday, I'll be telling you the story of a famous financial crime and giving you advice on how to avoid becoming a victim yourself. This episode is all about the financial crimes of former President Richard Nixon. He is remembered mostly for the Watergate scandal. You probably know the broad strokes of that. Politically motivated burglary, presidential wiretaps, threats of impeachment, and ultimately an unprecedented resignation. But what you might not know, and what I'll share today, is this. Nixon's misconduct wasn't just political. It was financial. From selling misconduct wasn't just political, it was financial. From selling ambassadorships to propping up milk prices in exchange for campaign donations, the 37th president of the United States committed some of the most brazen money crimes in American history. ABC Tuesday. You know how when you're living your life, and then all of a sudden you're out there helping cops solve crimes? That's me. Critics are calling High Potential a fun, slick crime procedural. I have an IQ of 160. I spot things that detectives miss. Caitlin Olsen is fantastic with razor-sharp wit and sass. I think it was murder in a cover-up, but I want to know how you know. Sounds like a challenge. It's brilliant television with a blend of humor and mystery. Got a dead body. Gotta go. High Potential. All new Tuesday, 10, 9 central on ABC and stream on Hulu. Long before Richard Milhouse Nixon became the first and only U.S. president to resign from office, he was a Duke University-educated attorney turned World War II naval officer. After the war ended, Nixon decided to try his hand at politics, running for Congress in 1946 when he was only 33 years old. Nixon won his first election with a tried-and-true strategy, scare tactics. He accused his opponent of being a communist sympathizer, and it worked. He took that same energy with him to Congress, where one of his first acts was writing legislation that forced all members of the American Communist Party to register with the Attorney General. Although the bill died when it reached the Senate, it put Nixon in the spotlight. Many Americans were swept up in the Red Scare at the time. They were terrified of communism, and they trusted Nixon to fight back against the perceived threat of the Soviet Union. That trust carried Nixon to the U.S. Senate in 1950, but he was just getting started. Only two years into his first term, he was tapped to be Dwight D. Eisenhower's running mate in the 1952 presidential election. But the extra scrutiny that came along with it got Nixon into some hot water. As the press dug more into his background, they found out that Nixon was selling political favors to his supporters in exchange for a slush fund that paid for his living expenses. The total was just $18,000, or about $211,000 in 2024 dollars. It's not a huge sum in politics, even in 1952, but people were outraged by the alleged corruption, regardless of the amount of cash involved. To get ahead of the story, Nixon commissioned an independent audit. Unsurprisingly, the audit found no evidence of wrongdoing, but it still wasn't enough to clear his name. In fact, it made people angrier, and there were calls to get Nixon off the ticket entirely. So on September 23, 1952, he addressed the nation on live TV. Nixon's defense was simple. He wasn't corrupt. He was just middle class. His office had expenses he couldn't afford to cover. So his supporters had raised money for line items like Christmas cards and campaign travel. In the name of transparency, Nixon went on to reveal intimate personal details of his family finances, trying to prove that he wasn't an especially wealthy man. His rebuttal became known as the Checkers Speech because there was one gift Nixon admitted to accepting from a supporter, his family's cocker spaniel, Checkers. 60 million Americans tuned into that speech, and many were pleasantly surprised. To them, it seemed like Nixon was being genuine. But even if the speech had totally backfired, it wouldn't have mattered much, at least in a legal sense. Prior to 1964, the House and the Senate didn't even have a formal set of rules about ethical conduct by their members. So they could do just about anything as long as they weren't breaking the law, like accepting a bribe. But what if that happened now? Today, U.S. senators can only accept gifts valued at less than $50, and only if the source of the gift is not a registered lobbyist, foreign agent, or private entity that employs one. There are few exceptions, including gifts from family members and gifts worth $250 or less given out of personal"
